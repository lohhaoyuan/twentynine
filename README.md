possible? project work for 2024

## the problem
hwa chong has a ton of school events, ranging from orientation for secondary ones, to global conventions for students who lead in their own communities. however, as someone 
who was part of the organising team for the 28th Student Leaders Convention, I realised that one of the most frustrating parts of the event was registration.

now most of the time the organising team has a very large google sheets with all the delegates and their allocations. something like this:

for the 28th SLC, there were multiple different groups, and different levels of subgroups, so we had different tables for each group for students to register. this would work, 
but unfortunately,

some students are very, *very* lost.

## the idea
what if we could create a better solution to large scale event registration? and, more importantly, what if we could make a better looking platform to register students?

**what if we made a glorified, over the top google sheet integration?**
